# Code Canvas - Personal Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), designed to serve as a personal and professional portfolio for Welliton Slaviero.

The portfolio showcases professional background, skills, and a collection of key projects, all presented with a clean, modern design and subtle animations. It is fully responsive and supports internationalization for both English and Portuguese.
